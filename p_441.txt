1. Explain days(!overnight) and days(overnight) to
someone who has just started learning R. What is the key fact
you need to know?

TRUE equals 1, FALSE equals 0

2. Create a vector of dates giving the first day of every month in
2015. Create a vector of dates giving the first day of every
month in the current year.

ymd(2015-01-01) + month(0:11)

floor(today(), unit = year) + month(0:11)

3. Write a function that, given your birthday (as a date), returns
how old you are in years.

h_age <- today() - ymd("y-m-d")

4. Why canâ€™t (today() %--% (today() + years(1))) /
months(1) work?

Intervlas and months are defined differently.
