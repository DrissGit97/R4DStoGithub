1. What happens to missing values in a histogram? What happens
to missing values in a bar chart? Why is there a difference in
how missing values are handled in histograms and bar charts?
2. What does na.rm = TRUE do in mean() and sum()?

In a histogram missing values are removed when creating the bins.
In a bar graph missing values are computed within a group called 'na'


3. Re-create the frequency plot of scheduled_dep_time colored
by whether the flight was cancelled or not. Also facet by the
cancelled variable. Experiment with different values of the
scales variable in the faceting function to mitigate the effect of
more noncancelled flights than cancelled flights.
