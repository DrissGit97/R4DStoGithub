1. Explore the distribution of each of the x, y, and z variables in
diamonds. What do you learn? Think about a diamond and
how you might decide which dimension is the length, width, and
depth.

p1 <- ggplot(diamonds, aes(x = x)) + geom_bar()
p2 <- ggplot(diamonds, aes(x = y)) + geom_bar()
p3 <- ggplot(diamonds, aes(x = z)) + geom_bar()
p1 + p2 + p3

the y and z values are pretty close to each other.

2. Explore the distribution of price. Do you discover anything
unusual or surprising? (Hint: Carefully think about the
binwidth and make sure you try a wide range of values.)

The price of the diamond depends directly on the size.

3. How many diamonds are 0.99 carat? How many are 1 carat?
What do you think is the cause of the difference?

Typing preferences mainly

4. Compare and contrast coord_cartesian() and xlim() or
ylim() when zooming in on a histogram. What happens if you
leave binwidth unset? What happens if you try to zoom so
only half a bar shows?

coord_cartesian doesn't change the data while xlim() and ylim() replace values outside the limits with NA.
