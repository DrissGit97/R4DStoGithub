1. Compare and contrast the results of paste0() with str_c()
for the following inputs:
str_c("hi ", NA)
str_c(letters[1:2], letters[1:3])

paste0 treats NA as a character while str_c treats it like a missing value.
str_c doesn't reproduce the letters while paste0 does.

2. Whatâ€™s the difference between paste() and paste0()? How
can you re-create the equivalent of paste() with str_c()?

paste0 is short for: paste(x, sep="") So it allows us to be lazier and more efficient. 

By using the arguments (str_c(..., sep = "", collapse = NULL))


3. Convert the following expressions from str_c() to
str_glue() or vice versa:
a. str_c("The price of ", food, " is ", price)
b. str_glue("I'm {age} years old and live in
{country}")
c. str_c("\\section{", title, "}")


str_glue("The price of {food} is {price})
str_c("I'm ", age, " years old and live in ", country)
str_glue("\\section\{{title}}"\}")
