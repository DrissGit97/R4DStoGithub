1. Run the following lines of code. Which of the two plots is saved
as mpg-plot.png? Why?
ggplot(mpg, aes(x = class)) +
geom_bar()
ggplot(mpg, aes(x = cty, y = hwy)) +
geom_point()
ggsave("mpg-plot.png")


The last one because it is the most recent.

 
2. What do you need to change in the previous code to save the
plot as a PDF instead of a PNG? How could you find out what
types of image files would work in ggsave()?

You would need to name the plot and input the name in ggsave's plot argument.
