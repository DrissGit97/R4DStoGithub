1. What is the problem with the following plot? How could you
improve it?
ggplot(mpg, aes(x = cty, y = hwy)) +
geom_point()

The data is overlapping. Using geom_jitter would be good.

2. What, if anything, is the difference between the two plots? Why?
ggplot(mpg, aes(x = displ, y = hwy)) +
geom_point()
ggplot(mpg, aes(x = displ, y = hwy)) +
geom_point(position = "identity")

There is no difference because geom_point() doesn't take the position argument

3. What parameters to geom_jitter() control the amount of
jittering?

width and height

4. Compare and contrast geom_jitter() with geom_count().

geom_jitter is better to use in cases where data overlaps. Otherwise, geom_count is better.

5. Whatâ€™s the default position adjustment for geom_boxplot()?
Create a visualization of the mpg dataset that demonstrates it.
