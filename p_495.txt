1. Can you explain what’s happening with the keys in this equi join?
Why are they different?
x |> full_join(y, by = "key")
#> # A tibble: 4 × 3
#> key val_x val_y
#> <dbl> <chr> <chr>
#> 1 1 x1 y1
#> 2 2 x2 y2
#> 3 3 x3 <NA>
#> 4 4 <NA> y3
x |> full_join(y, by = "key", keep = TRUE)
#> # A tibble: 4 × 4
#> key.x val_x key.y val_y
#> <dbl> <chr> <dbl> <chr>
#> 1 1 x1 1 y1
#> 2 2 x2 2 y2
#> 3 3 x3 NA <NA>
#> 4 NA <NA> 4 y3

In the first one it joins columns key.x and key.y into one while it keeps them separate in the latter one.

2. When finding if any party period overlapped with another party
period, we used q < q in the join_by()? Why? What happens if
you remove this inequality?

?
It doesn't show the overlapping dates and prints all of them instead.
