1. What happens if you facet on a continuous variable?

It creates too many separate graphs.

2. What do the empty cells in the plot with facet_grid(drv ~
cyl) mean? Run the following code. How do the cells relate to
the resulting plot?
ggplot(mpg) +
geom_point(aes(x = drv, y = cyl))

It means that there is no data for that range. 
The cells have the same size in every facet.

3. What plots does the following code make? What does . do?
ggplot(mpg) +
geom_point(aes(x = displ, y = hwy)) +
facet_grid(drv ~ .)
ggplot(mpg) +
geom_point(aes(x = displ, y = hwy)) +
facet_grid(. ~ cyl)

It creates a facet with only one variable. (on the x or y axis, depending on whether you input the dot before or after the facet variable)



4. Take the first faceted plot in this section:
ggplot(mpg) +
geom_point(aes(x = displ, y = hwy)) +
facet_wrap(~ class, nrow = 2)
What are the advantages to using faceting instead of the color
aesthetic? What are the disadvantages? How might the balance
change if you had a larger dataset?

The advantage is that it divides the information into different groups, avoiding clustering data.
The disadvantage is that it is harder to compare the data
If the dataset is larger, faceting would be easier to interpret.

5. Read ?facet_wrap. What does nrow do? What does ncol
do? What other options control the layout of the individual
panels? Why doesnâ€™t facet_grid() have nrow and ncol
arguments?

nrow defines the number of rows you split the facets into. ncol does the same for columns. There is also scales, labeller...
facet_grid doesn't have that because it only creates one facet based on the selected variable.

6. Which of the following plots makes it easier to compare engine
size (displ) across cars with different drivetrains? What does
this say about when to place a faceting variable across rows or
columns?
ggplot(mpg, aes(x = displ)) +
geom_histogram() +
facet_grid(drv ~ .)
ggplot(mpg, aes(x = displ)) +
geom_histogram() +
facet_grid(. ~ drv)

The first one is easier to compare because they are right on top of each other with the same x-axis.

7. Re-create the following plot using facet_wrap() instead of
facet_grid(). How do the positions of the facet labels
change?
ggplot(mpg) +
geom_point(aes(x = displ, y = hwy)) +
facet_grid(drv ~ .)

ggplot(mpg) +
geom_point(aes(x = displ, y = hwy)) +
facet_grid(drv ~ .)

ggplot(mpg) + 
  geom_point(aes(x = displ, y = hwy)) +
  facet_wrap(~drv, nrow = 3)
