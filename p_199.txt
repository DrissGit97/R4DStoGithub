1. What is the default geom associated with stat_summary()?
How could you rewrite the previous plot to use that geom
function instead of the stat function?

geom_errorbar(), geom_pointrange(), geom_linerange(), geom_crossbar()



2. What does geom_col() do? How is it different from
geom_bar()?

geom_bar() uses stat_count() by default: it counts the number of cases at each x position. geom_col() uses stat_identity() : it leaves the data as is.

3. Most geoms and stats come in pairs that are almost always
used in concert. Make a list of all the pairs. What do they have
in common? (Hint: Read through the documentation.)

They are found in https://ggplot2.tidyverse.org/reference/

4. What variables does stat_smooth() compute? What
arguments control its behavior?

x and y variables.
position, methods, formula, se, na.rm, orientation... (https://ggplot2.tidyverse.org/reference/geom_smooth.html)

5. In our proportion bar chart, we need to set group = 1. Why? In
other words, what is the problem with these two graphs?
ggplot(diamonds, aes(x = cut, y = after_stat(prop))) +
geom_bar()
ggplot(diamonds, aes(x = cut, fill = color, y =
after_stat(prop))) +
geom_bar()

If we don't, the height of the data will not be representative of the values.
