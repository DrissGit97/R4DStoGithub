1. What function would you use to read a file where fields were separated with |?

read_delim()

2. Apart from file, skip, and comment, what other arguments do read_csv()
and read_tsv() have in common?

All of them.

3. What are the most important arguments to read_fwf()?

The arguments that describe the length of every field.
fwf_widths() by their width or their positions with fwf_positions()

4. Sometimes strings in a CSV file contain commas. To prevent them from
causing problems, they need to be surrounded by a quoting character, like " or
'. By default, read_csv() assumes that the quoting character will be ". To
read the following text into a data frame, what argument to read_csv() do
you need to specify?

"x,y\n1,'a,b'"

quote 

5. Identify what is wrong with each of the following inline CSV files. What happens
when you run the code?

read_csv("a,b\n1,2,3\n4,5,6")

There are two named columns and three columns of data.

read_csv("a,b,c\n1,2\n1,2,3,4")

Three named columns and in the second row, two columns of data

read_csv("a,b\n\"1")

Two named columns and one row of data

read_csv("a,b\n1,2\na,b")

It treats numbers as characters because of the last row

read_csv("a;b\n1;3")

It treats a;b as one column and 1;3 as one row of data.


6. Practice referring to nonsyntactic names in the following data frame by:
a. Extracting the variable called 1.

annoying[1]

b. Plotting a scatterplot of 1 versus 2.
c. Creating a new column called 3, which is 2 divided by 1.
d. Renaming the columns to one, two, and three:

annoying <- tibble(
`1` = 1:10,
`2` = `1` * 2 + rnorm(length(`1`))
)
