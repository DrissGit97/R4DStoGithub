1. A number is even if itâ€™s divisible by two, which in R you can find
out with x %% 2 == 0. Use this fact and if_else() to
determine whether each number between 0 and 20 is even or
odd.

x <- (0:20)

if_else(x %% 2 == 0, even, odd)



2. Given a vector of days like x <- c("Monday",
"Saturday", "Wednesday"), use an ifelse() statement
to label them as weekends or weekdays.

ifelse(x == "Saturday", weekends, weekdays)

3. Use ifelse() to compute the absolute value of a numeric
vector called x.

ifelse(x > 0, x, -x)

4. Write a case_when() statement that uses the month and day
columns from flights to label a selection of important US
holidays (e.g., New Years Day, Fourth of July, Thanksgiving, and
Christmas). First create a logical column that is either TRUE or
FALSE, and then create a character column that either gives the
name of the holiday or is NA.


case_when(
month = celebration month & day = celebration day, HOLIDAY = TRUE, HOLIDAY = FALSE...)

case_when(
HOLIDAY = TRUE & month = celebration month & day = celebration day, holiday name, normal day)
