1. Why does this code not work?

my_variable <- 10
my_varıable
#> Error in eval(expr, envir, enclos): object
'my_varıable' not found
Look carefully! (This may seem like an exercise in
pointlessness, but training your brain to notice even the tiniest
difference will pay off when programming.)


the variables are written differently.

2. Tweak each of the following R commands so that they run
correctly:

libary(todyverse)
ggplot(dTA = mpg) +
geom_point(maping = aes(x = displ y = hwy)) +
geom_smooth(method = "lm)


library

ggplot(data

geom_point(mapping

geom_smooth(method = lm

3. Press Option+Shift+K/Alt+Shift+K. What happens? How can you
get to the same place using the menus?

I get access to the shortcut summary.


4. Let’s revisit an exercise from “Saving Your Plots”. Run the

following lines of code. Which of the two plots is saved as mpg-
plot.png? Why?

my_bar_plot <- ggplot(mpg, aes(x = class)) +
geom_bar()
my_scatter_plot <- ggplot(mpg, aes(x = cty, y = hwy)) +
geom_point()
ggsave(filename = "mpg-plot.png", plot = my_bar_plot)

my_bar_plot, because it is the one defined in the plot argument
