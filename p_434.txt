1. How does the distribution of flight times within a day change
over the course of the year?

flights |> filter(!is.na(dep_time)) |> group_by(year, month, day, hour) |> ggplot(aes(x = hour)) + geom_freqpoly(.group = month)


2. Compare dep_time, sched_dep_time, and dep_delay. Are
they consistent? Explain your findings.

flights |> filter(!is.na(dep_time)) |> group_by(year, month, day, hour) |> ggplot() + geom_freqpoly(aes(x = dep_time, color = "red")) + geom_freqpoly(aes(x = sched_dep_time, color = "blue")) + geom_freqpoly(aes(x = dep_delay, color = "darkgreen"))

No, they are not consistent. Most departures happen early in the day, before 5 AM, while most 
delays happen after 5 AM, peaking at around 8 AM, 3 PM AND 8 PM.

3. Compare air_time with the duration between the departure
and arrival. Explain your findings. (Hint: Consider the location of
the airport.)

We calculate a new 'air-time' based on the departure and arrival times and compare it to the column 'air-time'. We could also check the weather and plane data for more detail.

4. How does the average delay time change over the course of a
day? Should you use dep_time or sched_dep_time? Why?

It increases the later in the day it is.  dep_time, because that is the actual date the plane took off.

5. On what day of the week should you leave if you want to
minimize the chance of a delay?

Saturdays

6. What makes the distribution of diamonds$carat and
flights$sched_dep_time similar?

?

7. Confirm our hypothesis that the early departures of flights in
minutes 20–30 and 50–60 are caused by scheduled flights that
leave early. Hint: Create a binary variable that tells you whether
a flight was delayed.
