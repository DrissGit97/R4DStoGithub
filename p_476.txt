1. Find the 48 hours (over the course of the whole year) that have the
worst delays. Cross-reference it with the weather data. Can you
see any patterns?
2. Imagine you’ve found the top 10 most popular destinations using
this code:
top_dest <- flights2 |>
count(dest, sort = TRUE) |>
head(10)
How can you find all flights to those destinations?

self_join through dest

3. Does every departing flight have corresponding weather data for
that hour?

antijoin

4. What do the tail numbers that don’t have a matching record in
planes have in common? (Hint: One variable explains about 90%
of the problems.)

5. Add a column to planes that lists every carrier that has flown
that plane. You might expect that there’s an implicit relationship
between plane and airline, because each plane is flown by a single
airline. Confirm or reject this hypothesis using the tools you’ve
learned in previous chapters.

left_join

6. Add the latitude and the longitude of the origin and destination
airport to flights. Is it easier to rename the columns before or
after the join?



7. Compute the average delay by destination and then join on the
airports data frame so you can show the spatial distribution of
delays. Here’s an easy way to draw a map of the United States:
airports |>
semi_join(flights, join_by(faa == dest)) |>
ggplot(aes(x = lon, y = lat)) +
borders("state") +
geom_point() +
coord_quickmap()
You might want to use the size or color of the points to display
the average delay for each airport.


8. What happened on June 13, 2013? Draw a map of the delays, and
then use Google to cross-reference with the weather.
