1. Use what you’ve learned to improve the visualization of the
departure times of cancelled versus noncancelled flights.

nycflights13::flights |>
mutate(
cancelled = is.na(dep_time),

sched_hour = sched_dep_time %/% 100,
sched_min = sched_dep_time %% 100,
sched_dep_time = sched_hour + (sched_min / 60)
) |>
ggplot(aes(x = sched_dep_time)) +
geom_boxplot(aes(y = sched_dep_time, x = cancelled)

2. Based on EDA, what variable in the diamonds dataset appears
to be most important for predicting the price of a diamond? How
is that variable correlated with cut? Why does the combination
of those two relationships lead to lower-quality diamonds being
more expensive?

The size

3. Instead of exchanging the x and y variables, add
coord_flip() as a new layer to the vertical boxplot to create
a horizontal one. How does this compare to exchanging the
variables?

It does the same with less code.

4. One problem with boxplots is that they were developed in an era
of much smaller datasets and tend to display a prohibitively
large number of “outlying values.” One approach to remedy this
problem is the letter value plot. Install the lvplot package, and try
using geom_lv() to display the distribution of price versus cut.
What do you learn? How do you interpret the plots?

It has multiple ranges.

5. Create a visualization of diamond prices versus a categorical
variable from the diamonds dataset using geom_violin(),
then a faceted geom_histogram(), then a colored
geom_freqpoly(), and then a colored geom_density().
Compare and contrast the four plots. What are the pros and
cons of each method of visualizing the distribution of a
numerical variable based on the levels of a categorical variable?

Data is easier to compare when it is found in the same graph. If we facet the violin graphs it mitigates some of the separation but it is still more difficult to interpret them together.

6. If you have a small dataset, it’s sometimes useful to use
geom_jitter() to avoid overplotting to more easily see the
relationship between a continuous and categorical variable. The
ggbeeswarm package provides a number of methods similar to
geom_jitter(). List them and briefly describe what each one
does.

geom_beeswarm (jitters data into a 'beeswarm')
geom_quasirandom works similarly to geom_jitter but with different sequences
