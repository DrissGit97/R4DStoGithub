. How many rows are in penguins? How many columns?

glimpse(penguins)

2. What does the bill_depth_mm variable in the penguins data
frame describe? Read the help for ?penguins to find out.

?penguins -> bill_depth_mm

3. Make a scatterplot of bill_depth_mm versus
bill_length_mm. That is, make a scatterplot with
bill_depth_mm on the y-axis and bill_length_mm on the
x-axis. Describe the relationship between these two variables.

ggplot(penguins, aes(x = bill_length_mm, y = bill_depth_mm)) + geom_point()
There is a strong linear correlation between both.

4. What happens if you make a scatterplot of species versus
bill_depth_mm? What might be a better choice of geom?

It groups the bill_length_mm by species. A better choice would be a histogram.

5. Why does the following give an error, and how would you fix it?

ggplot(data = penguins) +
geom_point()

You need to add the y and x axis.

6. What does the na.rm argument do in geom_point()? What is
the default value of the argument? Create a scatterplot where
you successfully use this argument set to TRUE.

It defines whether to give a warning about removed missing values (FALSE) or to silently remove them (TRUE)

7. Add the following caption to the plot you made in the previous
exercise: “Data come from the palmerpenguins package.” Hint:
Take a look at the documentation for labs().

+ labs(caption = "etc")

8. Re-create the following visualization. What aesthetic should
bill_depth_mm be mapped to? And should it be mapped at
the global level or at the geom level?

ggplot(penguins, aes(x = flipper_length_mm, y = body_mass_g, color = bill_depth_mm)) + geom_point() + geom_smooth(blue)
Color, it can be mapped to ggplot or geom_point.


9. Run this code in your head and predict what the output will look
like. Then, run the code in R and check your predictions.

ggplot(
data = penguins,
mapping = aes(x = flipper_length_mm, y = body_mass_g,
color = island)
) +
geom_point() +
geom_smooth(se = FALSE)


It maps the x and y axis through a scatter plot and draws a line without displaying the confidence interval.
10. Will these two graphs look different? Why/why not?
ggplot(
data = penguins,
mapping = aes(x = flipper_length_mm, y = body_mass_g)
) +
geom_point() +
geom_smooth()
ggplot() +
geom_point(
data = penguins,
mapping = aes(x = flipper_length_mm, y =
body_mass_g)
) +
geom_smooth(
data = penguins,
mapping = aes(x = flipper_length_mm, y =
body_mass_g)
)


No, they will be the same. Plotting on a global level or on every individual level gives the same results.
