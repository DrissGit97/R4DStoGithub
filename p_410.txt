(DONE BEFORE -- EASY, SO I SKIPPED REDOING IT)

1. How have the proportions of people identifying as Democrat, Republican,
and Independent changed over time?

We group by partyid and plot time in x and partyid in y through a bar

2. How could you collapse rincome into a small set of categories?

fct_collapse()

3. Notice there are 9 groups (excluding other) in the previous fct_lump
example. Why not 10? (Hint: Type ?fct_lump, and find the default for the
argument other_level is “Other.”)

It's because by default it groups the rest into 'Others'
