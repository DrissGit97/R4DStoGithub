1. Create strings that contain the following values:
a. He said "That's amazing!"
b. \a\b\c\d
c. \\\\\\

r{{}}
we escape the \ with \\, etc

2. Create the following string in your R session and print it. What
happens to the special “\u00a0”? How does str_view()
display it? Can you do a little Googling to figure out what this
special character is?
x <- "This\u00a0is\u00a0tricky"

It's a blank space.
