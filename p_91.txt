1. Compare dep_time, sched_dep_time, and dep_delay.
How would you expect those three numbers to be related?

sched_dep_time - dep_time = dep_delay

2. Brainstorm as many ways as possible to select dep_time,
dep_delay, arr_time, and arr_delay from flights.

select(dep_time....
select(starts_with(dep_delay) or ends_with(delay)
...

3. What happens if you specify the name of the same variable
multiple times in a select() call?

It brings it up once.

4. What does the any_of() function do? Why might it be helpful
in conjunction with this vector?
variables <- c("year", "month", "day", "dep_delay",
"arr_delay")

any_of(), in conjuntion with select, works like the or logical operator and brings all the selected variables, without bringing up NAs.


5. Does the result of running the following code surprise you? How
do the select helpers deal with upper- and lowercase by default?
How can you change that default?
flights |> select(contains("TIME"))

Yes, because it is case insensitive.
To make it case sensitive we use the ignore.case, setting it to FALSE.

6. Rename air_time to air_time_min to indicate units of
measurement and move it to the beginning of the data frame.

mutate(air_time = air_time_min) |> relocate(air_time_min)

7. Why doesnâ€™t the following work, and what does the error mean?
flights |>
select(tailnum) |>
arrange(arr_delay)
#> Error in `arrange()`:
#> i In argument: `..1 = arr_delay`.
#> Caused by error:
#> ! object 'arr_delay' not found

you filtered everything but tailnum and then asked for a variable you discarded.
