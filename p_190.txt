1. What geom would you use to draw a line chart? A boxplot? A
histogram? An area chart?

geom_point and geom_smooth
geom_boxplot
geom_histogram
geom_line()

2. Earlier in this chapter we used show.legend without explaining
it:
ggplot(mpg, aes(x = displ, y = hwy)) +
geom_smooth(aes(color = drv), show.legend = FALSE)
What does show.legend = FALSE do here? What happens if
you remove it? Why do you think we used it earlier?

show_legend = FALSE removes the legend from the chart.
If you remove it, the legend would show because showing it is the default setting.

3. What does the se argument to geom_smooth() do?

It controls the confidence interval, it shows it or hides it.

4. Re-create the R code necessary to generate the following
graphs. Note that wherever a categorical variable is used in the
plot, itâ€™s drv.

geom_point + geom_smooth
geom_point + geom_smooth(.group = drv)
geom_point(color = drv) + geom_smooth(.group = drv, color = drv)
geom_point(color = drv) + geom_smooth( color = "blue")
geom_point(color = drv) + geom_smooth
geom_point(color = drv) + geom_smooth (.group = drv, linetype = drv)
geom_point(color = drv) + geom_point(color = "white", size = +3)
