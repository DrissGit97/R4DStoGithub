1. The mpg data frame that is bundled with the ggplot2 package
contains 234 observations collected by the US Environmental
Protection Agency on 38 car models. Which variables in mpg
are categorical? Which variables are numerical? (Hint: Type ?
mpg to read the documentation for the dataset.) How can you
see this information when you run mpg?

Categorical: manufacturer, model, year, cyl(could be numerical too), trans, drv, fl, class
Numerical: displ, cty, hwy, 


2. Make a scatterplot of hwy versus displ using the mpg data
frame. Next, map a third, numerical variable to color, then
size, then both color and size, and then shape. How do
these aesthetics behave differently for categorical versus
numerical variables?

ggplot(mpg, aes(y = hwy, x = displ)) + geom_point()

ggplot(mpg, aes(y = hwy, x = displ, color = drv)) + geom_point()
ggplot(mpg, aes(y = hwy, x = displ, size = drv)) + geom_point()
ggplot(mpg, aes(y = hwy, x = displ, size = drv, color = drv)) + geom_point()
ggplot(mpg, aes(y = hwy, x = displ, shape = drv)) + geom_point()

numerical variables should not be used in color, shape... because there are too many of them for it to be useful.

3. In the scatterplot of hwy versus displ, what happens if you
map a third variable to linewidth?

It doesn't change the graph because it does not use lines.

4. What happens if you map the same variable to multiple
aesthetics?

It shows the same color, shape... for each group. It is useful when data overlaps a lot but otherwise it is useless.

5. Make a scatterplot of bill_depth_mm versus
bill_length_mm and color the points by species. What
does adding coloring by species reveal about the relationship
between these two variables? What about faceting by species?

ggplot(penguins, aes(y = bill_depth_mm, x = bill_length_mm, color = species)) + geom_point()
ggplot(penguins, aes(y = bill_depth_mm, x = bill_length_mm, color = species)) + geom_point() + facet_wrap(~species)

It shows that each species has similar attributes. It is useful to show the data in a more detailed way.



6. Why does the following yield two separate legends? How would
you fix it to combine the two legends?
ggplot(
data = penguins,
mapping = aes(
x = bill_length_mm, y = bill_depth_mm,
color = species, shape = species
)
) +
geom_point() +
labs(color = "Species")


To join the two legends, the name has to be exactly the same, without lower or upper case variations.


7. Create the two following stacked bar plots. Which question can
you answer with the first one? Which question can you answer
with the second one?
ggplot(penguins, aes(x = island, fill = species)) +
geom_bar(position = "fill")
ggplot(penguins, aes(x = species, fill = island)) +
geom_bar(position = "fill")

The first one represents the species count per island. 
The second one represents the same information but in a different way.
