1. Brainstorm at least five ways to assess the typical delay
characteristics of a group of flights. When is mean() useful?
When is median() useful? When might you want to use
something else? Should you use arrival delay or departure
delay? Why might you want to use data from planes?

mean is useful when you do not have a lot of outliers
median is useful when you do
departure delay 

2. Which destinations show the greatest variation in air speed?

flights |> filter(!is.na(distance), !is.na(air_time)) |> group_by(dest) |> mutate(avg_air_speed = mean(distance/air_time), .before = 1)

3. Create a plot to further explore the adventures of EGE. Can you
find any evidence that the airport moved locations? Can you find
another variable that might explain the difference?
