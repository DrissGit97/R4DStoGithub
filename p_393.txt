(DONE BEFORE -- EASY, SO I SKIPPED REDOING IT)

1. For each of the following challenges, try solving them by using both
a single regular expression and a combination of multiple
str_detect() calls:
a. Find all words that start or end with x.

^x | x$

b. Find all words that start with a vowel and end with a
consonant.

^[aeiou].*[^aeiou]$

c. Are there any words that contain at least one of each different
vowel?

[a] & [e] ... 

2. Construct patterns to find evidence for and against the rule “i before
e except after c.”

.*[i].*[e] & ![c][i][e]

3. colors() contains a number of modifiers like “lightgray” and
“darkblue.” How could you automatically identify these modifiers?
(Think about how you might detect and then remove the colors that
are modified.)

light*
dark* 

filter ! start_with light | dark

4. Create a regular expression that finds any base R dataset. You can
get a list of these datasets via a special use of the data() function:
data(package = "datasets")$results[, "Item"]. Note
that a number of old datasets are individual vectors; these contain
the name of the grouping “data frame” in parentheses, so you’ll
need to strip them off.
