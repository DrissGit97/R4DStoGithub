1. For each of the sample tables, describe what each observation and each column
represents.

An observation refers to each row while columns refers to how the variables within each observation behave.


(Question number two skipped because the book itself said you needed operations not mentioned in the unit)
2. Sketch out the process you’d use to calculate the rate for table2 and table3. You
will need to perform four operations:
a. Extract the number of TB cases per country per year.
b. Extract the matching population per country per year.
c. Divide cases by population, and multiply by 10,000.
d. Store back in the appropriate place.
You haven’t yet learned all the functions you’d need to actually perform these
operations, but you should still be able to think through the transformations you’d need.
