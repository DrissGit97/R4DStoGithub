1. Explain in words what each line of the code used to generate
Figure 13-1 does.

group_by joins variables into a group
summarize creates a new column that calculates the mean
filter removes flights that start after 1
then the rest make a plot with a line and points that vary depending on density

2. What trigonometric functions does R provide? Guess some
names and look up the documentation. Do they use degrees or
radians?

All of them. They use radians.

3. Currently dep_time and sched_dep_time are convenient to
look at but hard to compute with because they’re not really
continuous numbers. You can see the basic problem by running
the following code; there’s a gap between each hour:

flights |>
filter(month == 1, day == 1) |>
ggplot(aes(x = sched_dep_time, y = dep_delay)) +
geom_point()
Convert them to a more truthful representation of time (either
fractional hours or minutes since midnight).

We can use %% for hours and %/% for minutes

4. Round dep_time and arr_time to the nearest five minutes.
