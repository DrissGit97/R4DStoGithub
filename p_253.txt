1. Use geom_text() with infinite positions to place text at the
four corners of the plot.

?geom_text

2. Use annotate() to add a point geom in the middle of your last
plot without having to create a tibble. Customize the shape, size,
or color of the point.

?annotate()

3. How do labels with geom_text() interact with faceting? How
can you add a label to a single facet? How can you put a
different label in each facet? (Hint: Think about the dataset that
is being passed to geom_text().)

They apply to every facet. 

To make it apply to only one facet, you add acolum to the label data frame (e.g. class = "seater")

4. What arguments to geom_label() control the appearance of
the background box?

?geom_label()

5. What are the four arguments to arrow()? How do they work?
Create a series of plots that demonstrate the most important
options.

?arrow()
