1. Turn a stacked bar chart into a pie chart using
coord_polar().

pie <- ggplot(mtcars, aes(x = factor(1), fill = factor(cyl))) +
 geom_bar(width = 1)
pie + coord_polar(theta = "y")

2. Whatâ€™s the difference between coord_quickmap() and
coord_map()?

coord_map() projects a portion of the earth, which is approximately spherical.
coord_quickmap() is a quick approximation that does preserve straight lines. It works best for smaller areas closer to the equator.

3. What does the following plot tell you about the relationship
between city and highway mpg? Why is coord_fixed()
important? What does geom_abline() do?
ggplot(data = mpg, mapping = aes(x = cty, y = hwy)) +
geom_point() +
geom_abline() +
coord_fixed()

coordfixed makes it so that the y and x axis have the same dimensions. Abline splits the graph through the middle, telling us that 
hwy is always higher than cty.
