1. Create a scatterplot of hwy versus displ where the points are
pink filled-in triangles.

ggplot(mpg, aes(x = hwy, y = displ)) + geom_point(color = "pink", shape = "triangle")

2. Why did the following code not result in a plot with blue points?
ggplot(mpg) +
geom_point(aes(x = displ, y = hwy, color = "blue"))

color needs to be outside the aesthetics.

3. What does the stroke aesthetic do? What shapes does it work
with? (Hint: Use ?geom_point.)

stroke controls the 'countour' around the geometric figures.

4. What happens if you map an aesthetic to something other than
a variable name, like aes(color = displ < 5)? Note, youâ€™ll
also need to specify x and y.

It changes the color of the data that returns TRUE.
