1. We forgot to draw the relationship between weather and
airports in Figure 19-1. What is the relationship, and how
should it appear in the diagram?

origin 


2. weather contains information for only the three origin airports in
NYC. If it contained weather records for all airports in the US, what
additional connection would it make to flights?

Information about the weather


3. The year, month, day, hour, and origin variables almost form
a compound key for weather, but there’s one hour that has
duplicate observations. Can you figure out what’s special about
that hour?



4. We know that some days of the year are special and fewer people
than usual fly on them (e.g., Christmas Eve and Christmas Day).
How might you represent that data as a data frame? What would
be the primary key? How would it connect to the existing data
frames?

datetime, holiday_name

the primary key would be datetime

It would connect to flights, etc. through the primary key datetime

5. Draw a diagram illustrating the connections between the Batting,
People, and Salaries data frames in the Lahman package.
Draw another diagram that shows the relationship between
People, Managers, and AwardsManagers. How would you
characterize the relationship between the Batting, Pitching,
and Fielding data frames?

You find the details through ?table_name or through view
You check the foreign keys
You create a diagram showing the connections
