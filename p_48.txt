1. Make a bar plot of species of penguins, where you assign
species to the y aesthetic. How is this plot different?

ggplot(penguins) + geom_bar(aes(y = species))

It represents the count of species horizontally.

2. How are the following two plots different? Which aesthetic,
color or fill, is more useful for changing the color of bars?
ggplot(penguins, aes(x = species)) +
geom_bar(color = "red")
ggplot(penguins, aes(x = species)) +
geom_bar(fill = "red")

fill colors the entire bar while color countours it with the defined color.

3. What does the bins argument in geom_histogram() do?

bins is different from binwidth in that it defines the number of bins, instead of the width of the bins.

4. Make a histogram of the carat variable in the diamonds
dataset that is available when you load the tidyverse package.
Experiment with different binwidth values. What value reveals
the most interesting patterns?

ggplot(diamonds) + geom_histogram(aes(y = carat))

In this case, a lower binwidth reveals more details in the graph.
