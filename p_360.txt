1. When computing the distribution of the length of baby names,
why did we use wt = n?

We did it to add together the total count of each baby name

2. Use str_length() and str_sub() to extract the middle
letter from each baby name. What will you do if the string has an
even number of characters?

We check first if the name has an even or odd number of letters. If it's odd, we remove only one letter and if it's even, two.

3. Are there any major trends in the length of baby names over
time? What about the popularity of first and last letters?

Yes, shorter names are becoming more popular...
