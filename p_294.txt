1. How does dplyr::near() work? Type near to see the
source code. Is sqrt(2)^2 near 2?

It compares two floating point numbers with a built in tolerance
Yes, sqrt(2)^2 is near 2 



2. Use mutate(), is.na(), and count() together to describe
how the missing values in dep_time, sched_dep_time, and
dep_delay are connected.

flights |> mutate(missing = (!is.na(dep_time) & is.na(dep_delay))) |> filter(missing)
flights |> mutate(missing = (is.na(dep_time) & !is.na(dep_delay))) |> filter(missing)
etc...

This way we see when one variable is missing or not based on the other mentioned ones.
